# Todo Website (Practice Repo)

Practice repository for a fullstack engineering class. Use it as a sandbox to learn basic HTML/CSS/JS structure and simple Git workflows.

## Contents
- `index.html` – entry point
- `home.html` – home page sample
- `about.html` – about page sample
- `contact.html` – contact page sample
- `map.html` – placeholder map page
- `css/` – stylesheets (`custom.css`, `sample.css`, `style.css`)
- `js/` – scripts (`custom.js`, `input.js`, `output.js`)

## Quick start
Open `index.html` in your browser, or serve the folder with any static file server to explore the pages. Test changes by editing the HTML/CSS/JS files and refreshing the browser.
